    <h1>Registry</h1>
    <p>We are so delighted you are coming to our wedding. A gift is not
    necessary. Thank you for being in our lives, and celebrating our commitment
    to each other. If you feel you really must, well, OK. We are registered at
    a few venues via <a href="http://www.myregistry.com/wedding-registry/Margot-Geever-Charles-Pina-San-Francisco-CA/613706">myregistry.com</a>.
    Or, if you'd like to help sponsor some of our honeymoon activities 
    (our dream is to travel to <strike>Scotland</strike> Japan), please
    consider taking a look at the website for our 
    <a href="https://www.wanderable.com/hm/MargotandCharles">honeymoon fund</a>. 
    There you can pitch in for things like a stay at a bed and breakfast, a
    scotch tasting, or a couple of giant bowls of ramen.
