    <h1>Registry</h1>
    <p>We are so delighted you are coming to our wedding. A gift is not
    necessary. Thank you for being in our lives, and celebrating our commitment
    to each other. If you feel you really must, well, OK. There are a couple of
    choices.
    </p>
    <h2>Honeyfund</h2>
    <p>
    Our dream is to travel to Scotland for our honeymoon. There is an
    interesting website which allows friends and family to sponsor activities like
    a stay at a bed and breakfast, a scotch tasting, or a meal at a nice restaurant. If you
    like, please feel free to contribute to <a href="http://honeyfund.com">our honeyfund</a> 
    en lieu of a physical gift.
    </p>
    <h2>Traditional Registry</h2>
    <p>If you prefer, we are also maintaining a more traditional registery at a few venues via <a href="http://theknot.com">this website</a>.</p>
